The Learning and Emerging Networked Systems (LENS) Laboratory at 002 WEB is co-directed by [Prof. Srinivas Shakkottai](https://cesg.tamu.edu/people-2/faculty/srinivas-shakkottai/) and [Prof. Dileep Kalathil](http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/). The objectives of the laboratory are to conduct analytical and experimental research in machine learning with networked systems applications, and to facilitate the integration of research into undergraduate and graduate education. The latter objective is directly aimed at enhancing the academic experience of engineering students at Texas A&M University. Key to the success of this program is the current enthusiasm among students for emerging technologies, including distributed learning and control platforms that operate over the network stack.
