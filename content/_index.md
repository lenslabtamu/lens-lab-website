      subtitle: ''
      text: We work with different programming environments, including [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), python packages for machine learning, open source communication stacks such as [srsRAN](https://www.srslte.com/), and [OpenFlow](https://www.opennetworking.org/) for software defined networking (SDN).Hardware support includes GPU workstations from [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/), Software Defined Radios (SDR) from [National Instruments](https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/white-papers/11/what-is-ni-usrp-hardware-.html) in both sub-six and mm-wave bands, a variety of robots such as [Jackal UGVs](https://clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/), [Turtlebots](https://www.turtlebot.com/) and [Amazon DeepRacers](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) and assorted Android-based smart devices.We are also supported in conducting real-world field experiments by the [Bush Combat Development Complex](https://bcdc.tamus.edu/) located at a former Air Force base located about ten miles away from the main campus.Participants are encouraged to act as a community of experts and talk about their experiences with one another. Prototyping often poses many technical challenges. Getting involved at the LENS lab entails being exposed to the frustrations and the rewards associated with open-ended engineering problems. <br> <br> {{< youtube auUnazOFeeE >}} <br>  The lab is supported through the sponsorship of several organizations including Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, National Instruments, Google, the National Science Foundation, and The US Army Futures Command, among others. <br> <br> **Aggie Deep Racers** <br>  This is an initiative specifically aimed at applied machine learning in a robotics context using the [Amazon DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) platform. <br> <br> ![Lens robot image](lensrobotimage.jpg)
